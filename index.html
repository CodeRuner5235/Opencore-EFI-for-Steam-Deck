    <h1>Opencore for Steam Deck</h1>
    <p>This project is for using <a href="https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/">Opencore</a> to run MacOS on the Valve Steam Deck.</p>
    <p>The MacOS versions that I will be targeting are Catalina (10.15) and Big Sur (11). The Project can be found <a href="https://github.com/CodeRuner5235/Opencore-EFI-for-Steam-Deck">here.</a></p>
    <p>My reasoning here is that Apple changed a lot of things between Big Sur and Monterey so I will be focusing on these two versions for now. I will deninetly try to get Montery and up running in the future.</p>
