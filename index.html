    <h1>Opencore for Steam Deck</h1>
    <p>This project is for using <a href="https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/">Opencore</a> to run MacOS on the Valve Steam Deck.</p>
    <p>The MacOS versions that I will be targeting are Catalina (10.15) and Big Sur (11). The Project can be found <a href="https://github.com/CodeRuner5235/Opencore-EFI-for-Steam-Deck">here.</a></p>
    <p>My reasoning here is that Apple changed a lot of things between Big Sur and Monterey so I will be focusing on these two versions for now. I will deninetly try to get Monterey and up running in the future.</p>
    <p>As of right now, there are many, MANY, issues the must be overcome before MacOS is even remotely usable in the Steam Deck. My first and foremost concern is getting the installer to boot using successfully while using the built in screen. This should be (hopefully) possible by spoofing the custom APU to an Intel iGPU. If by some miracle this works, the next issue is graphics accelleration. Hopefully, this issue can be fixed with what the guys at <a href="https://github.com/NootInc/WhateverRed">WhateverRed</a> are working on. In fact, their project is why I am limiting the MacOS versions to Catalina and Big Sur. If (and big if) we can get these two issues sorted out, we only have a couple other things to worry about.</p>
    <p>   1. Wifi/Bluetooth- Unfortunelty, it looks like the wifi chipset that the Steam Deck uses is from Realtek wich basicly means that it will by unsupported with no fixing it. So if you want wifi you will probably have to use an external wifi dongal though the type-C port.</p>
    <p>   2. Type-C and SD card reader- Kinda nessecary to do anything. Shouldnt be too hard to get working.</p>
    <p>   3. Touch screen/mouse pads- Hoping that the touch screen uses Multitouch HID and we can use a VoodooI2C plugin.</p>
    <p>   4. Audio</p>
    <p>   5. Controller controls- I am hoping this can be fixed by installing steam and using its mapping. If not, ACPI patching will probably be needed.</p>
    <p>   6. Everything else- Things like the webcam, microphone, etc...</p>
    <p>Any and all help is welcome form people who want to test, to people who know how to use Opencore.</p>
    <p>If you have anything you want to add or any ideas, discussions are always open!</p>
    <p>Laslty, no judging my webpage work. I know its not the best looking.</p>
